In case of multi variables  mode or dealing with many secondary variables which is hard to \\npredict spatial distribution and dependency between variables, correlation matrix is  a key element  to \\ndescribe this dependency . The principal directions of data set variance are defined by pri ncipal \\ncomponents. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure to calculate eigenvalues  and \\neigenvectors of correlation matrix  which are principal component of data set , by dimension reduction.   \\n Introduction  \\nDependency refers to any statistical relationship between two random variables or two sets of data. Correlation refers to any of a broad class of statistical relationship involving dependence. Correlation between two set of data set 𝑋,𝑌 defined as:  \\n𝜌𝑋𝑌=𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟 (𝑋,𝑌)= 𝐶𝑜𝑣 (𝑋,𝑌)\\n𝜎𝑋𝜎𝑌=𝐸[(𝑋−𝜇𝑋)(𝑌−𝜇𝑌]\\n𝜎𝑋𝜎𝑌 (1) \\n𝐶𝑜𝑣 (𝑋,𝑌)=1\\n𝑁� (𝑋𝑖𝑛\\n𝑖=1−𝜇𝑋)(𝑌𝑖−𝜇𝑌) (2) \\n𝜎𝑋=�∑ (𝑋𝑖−𝜇𝑋)𝑛\\n𝑖=1\\n𝑛          𝜎𝑌=�∑ (𝑌𝑖−𝜇𝑌)𝑛\\n𝑖=1\\n𝑛 (3) \\nWhere 𝜌,𝐸 𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝐶𝑜𝑣 , are correlation, expected value and covariance operator respectively, 𝜇   is the \\nmean, 𝜎 is standard deviation  and 𝑛 is number of variables.  The correlation is +1 in the case of a perfect \\npositive linear relationship, −1 in th e case of a perfect negative linear relationship,  and some value \\nbetween −1 and 1 in all other cases, indicating the degree of linear dependence  between the variables. As \\nit approaches zero there is less of a relationship (closer to uncorrelated). The clos er the coefficient is to \\neither −1 or 1, the stronger the correlation between the variables. The correlation cannot exceed 1 in absolute value. When correlations among several variables are computed, they are typically \\nsummarized in the form of a correlati on matrix. Correlation matrices are built to describe the dependency \\nbetween different data sets and are symmetric as 𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟 (𝑋,𝑌)=𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟 (𝑌,𝑋). Correlation matrices must be \\npositive semi definite. It means for all Non -zero column vector  𝑍, 𝑍\\n𝑇𝜌𝑍>0 (𝑍𝑇 is the transpose of 𝑍 and  \\n𝜌 is correlation matrix).  \\nThe subject of multivariate analysis deals with the statistical analysis of the data collected on \\nmore than one variable. These variables may be correlated with each other, and their statistical \\ndependence is often taken into account when analyzing such data. Correlation matrix is a key element to \\nexplain and apply this dependency in multi variable mode.  In reservoir estimation the primary well data, \\nwhich is expensive to obtain by drilling is p redicted using the easy and cheap obtaining secondary seismic \\ndata.  Correlation matrix can be useful for spatial prediction and dimension reduction when we are dealing with many secondary variables  (Kumar , A. and Deutsch, C.V. , 2009, CCG annual report ). \\n \\nEigenvalues and eigenvectors : \\nPrincipal component of a data set are found by calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the data \\ncovariance matrix. In fact, eigenvalues are the variance of principal components .  Suppose that A is a \\nsquare matrix of size n, 𝑋≠0 is a vector in 𝐶\\n𝑛, and λ  is a scalar in C. Then 𝑋 is an eigenvector of A with \\neigenvalue λ, if 𝐴𝑋=λX.  The eigenvalues of a matrix  A are precisely the solutions λ to the characteristic \\nequation ( I is identity matrix).  \\ndet(𝐴−λI)=0 \\ndet(𝐴−λI)=det��𝑎11 0\\n0  𝑎22⋯   0\\n0   0\\n⋮   ⋮\\n0  0⋱  0\\n  0   𝑎𝑛𝑛�−λ�10\\n01… 0\\n… 0\\n⋮⋮\\n00⋱0\\n01��  \\n \\n \\n \\n(4) ', metadata={'source': 'data/stats.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

When we deal with large size of \\nmatrices, get the eigenvalues and eigenvectors from characteristic equation is not an easy job. There are \\ntwo classes of numerical methods to calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors  (Panhuis , P.H.M. , 2005) : (1) \\nPartial methods  - computation of extrema eigenvalues such as power method, and (2) Global methods  - \\napproximation of whole spectrum such as:  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) , Multi -Dimensional Scaling \\n(MDS), and Factorization .  This report provides an introduction to global methods and specifically focuses \\non PCA method. MDS and factorization will be covered in future works.  \\n \\nPrincipal Co mponent Analysis (PCA) : \\nPrincipal Component Analysis, or simply PCA, is a statistical procedure concerned with elucidating the \\ncovariance structure of a set of variables. In particular it allows us to identify the principal directions in \\nwhich the data varies. Principal Component  Analysis (PCA) is a method of identifying the pattern of data \\nset by a much smaller number of “new” variables, named as principal components  (Gillies,D., ,2005) .

If we place the [U,V] axis system at the mean of the data (𝜇𝑥, 𝜇𝑦) it \\ngives us a compact representation. If we transform each [X,Y ] coordinate into its corresponding [U,V] \\nvalue, the data is de -correlated, meaning that the co -variance between the U and V variables is zero.  For \\na given set of data, principal component analysis ﬁnds the axis system deﬁned by the principal directions o\\nf  v a r i a n c e  ( i e  t h e  [ U , V ]  a x i s  s y s t e m  i n  ﬁ g u r e  1 )  .

In this case we show the nominal extent of the \\nnormal distribution by a hyper -ellipse (the two dimensional ellipse in Figure1). The hyper ellipse encloses \\ndata points that are thought of as belonging to a class. It is drawn at a distance beyond which the \\nprobability of a point belonging to the class is low, and can be thought of as a class boundary.  \\nIf the variation in the data is caused by some other relationship, then PCA gives us a way of \\nreducing the dimensionali ty of a data set. Consider two variables that are nearly related linearly as shown \\nin ﬁgure2. As in ﬁgure1 the principal direction in which the data varies is shown by the U axis and the \\nsecondary direction by the V axis. However in this case all the V coo rdinates are very close to zero. We \\nmay assume, for example, that they are only non -zero because of experimental noise  or measurement \\n  ', metadata={'source': 'data/stats.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Thus we \\nhave reduced the  dimensionality of the problem by 1.  \\nIn computational terms the principal components are found by calculating the eigenvectors and \\neigenvalues of the data covariance matrix. This process is equivalent to finding the axis system in which \\nthe co -variance mat rix is diagonal. The eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue is the direction of greatest \\nvariation, the one with the second largest eigenvalue is the (orthogonal) direction with the next highest \\nvariation and so on. In the other word, eigenvalues are the variance of principal components. The first \\neigenvalue is the variance of the first principal component; the second eigenvalue is the variance of the \\nsecond principal component and so on (Gillies,D., 2005) . \\nThe eigenvalues of A, 𝑛 ×𝑛 matrix, are defined as the roots of:  \\ndet(𝐴−λ)=|𝐴−λI|=0 (5) \\nLet λ be an eigenvalue of A. Then there exists a vector 𝑥 such that:  \\n𝐴𝑥=λ𝑥 (6) \\nThe vector 𝑥  is called an eigenvector of A, associated with the eigenvalue λ . Notice that there is no \\nunique solution for 𝑥  in the above equation. It is a direction vector only and can be scaled to any \\nmagnitude. To find a numerical solution for 𝑥 we need to set one of its elements to an arbitrary value, say \\n1, which gives us a set of simultaneous equations to solve for the other elements. If there is no solution \\nwe repeat the process with another element. Ordinarily we normalize the final values so that 𝑥  has length \\none, that is 𝑥 .𝑥𝑇=1. \\nSuppose we have a 3×3 matrix A with eigenvectors 𝑥1,𝑥2,𝑥3 and eigenvalues λ1,λ2,λ3 so: \\n𝐴𝑥1=λ1𝑥1                  𝐴𝑥2=𝜆2𝑥2                𝐴𝑥3=𝜆3𝑥3                 (7) \\nPutting the eigenvectors as the columns of a matrix gives:  \\n𝐴[𝑥1𝑥2𝑥3]=�λ1 0 0\\n0λ2 0\\n0 0λ3�[𝑥1𝑥2𝑥3]   (8) \\nWriting:  \\n𝜑=[𝑥1𝑥2𝑥3]                     ʌ=�λ1 0 0\\n0λ2 0\\n0 0λ3�  (9) \\nGives us the matrix equation:  \\n𝐴𝜑=ʌ𝜑  (10) \\nWe normalized the eigenvectors to unit magnitude, and they are orthogonal, so:  \\n𝜑𝜑𝑇=𝜑𝑇𝜑=𝐼  (5) \\nThis means that:  \\n𝜑𝑇𝐴𝜑=ʌ  (6) \\nAnd:  \\n𝐴=𝜑ʌ𝜑𝑇  (7) \\nN o w  l e t  u s  c o n s i d e r  h o w  t h i s  a p p l i e s  t o  t h e  c o v a r i a n c e  m a t r i x  i n  t h e  P C A  p r o c e s s .  L e t  Σ  b e  a  𝑛×𝑛 \\ncovariance matrix. There is an orthogonal  𝑛 ×𝑛 matrix 𝜑 whose columns are eigenvectors of Σ and a \\ndiagonal matrix ʌ  whose diagonal elements are the eigenvalues of Σ, such that:  \\n𝜑Σ𝜑𝑇=ʌ  (8) \\nWe can look on the matrix of eigenvectors 𝜑 as a linear transformation which, in the example of figure1 \\ntransforms data points in the [X, Y] axis system into the [U,V] axis system. In the general case the linear transformation given by 𝜑  transforms the data points into a data set where the variabl es are \\nuncorrelated. The correlation matrix of the data in the new coordinate system is ʌ which has zeros in all \\nthe off diagonal elements.  \\nPrincipal component analysis is appropriate when you have obtained measures on a number of \\nobserved variables and wi sh to develop a smaller number of artificial variables (called principal \\ncomponents) that will account for most of the variance in the observed variables.  Some limitations of PCA  \\n(Izenman, A. J.,2008) : (1) The directions with largest variance are assumed to be of most interest.  (2) We \\nonly consider orthogonal transformations (rotations) of the original variables. (Kernel PCA is an extension \\nof PCA that allows non -linear mappings).  (3) PCA is based only on the mean vector and the covariance \\nmatrix of the da ta.

If \\nthe original variables were uncorrelated, PCA does nothin g, except for ordering them according to their \\nvariance.  (5) PCA is not scale invariant.  \\n \\nImplementation  \\nIn this study, a program written in fortran90 code used to calculate correlation matrix, eigenvalues and \\neigenvectors for a data set with six variables. This code reads data set in ASCII format,  deletes null values \\n(use full valued subset to delete -999)  and it calculate s Mean, Standard deviation, Covariance and \\nCorrelation matrix for data set.

The  rows and columns of \\nFigure  3 correspond to the six variables included in the analysis: Row 1 (and column 1) represents variable \\n1, row 2 (and column 2) represents variable 2, and so forth. When a given row and column intersect, you \\nwill find the correlation between the two correspond ing variables. For example, where the row for \\nvariable 2 intersects with the column for variable 1, you find a correlation of 0.14 ; this means that the \\ncorrelation between variables 1 and 2 is 0.14 . \\nBased on Figure 3, variables 2, 5 and 6 show relatively s trong positive correlation with one another \\n(𝜌25=0.76  ,𝜌26=0.66 ,𝜌56=0.56 ) . \\nVariable 4 shows relatively strong negative correlation with variable 2, 5 and 6  (𝜌\\n42=−0.73  ,𝜌45=−0.59 ,𝜌46=−0.46 ). \\nVariable 3 also shows negative correlation with variab le 2, 5 and 6 \\n (𝜌32=−0.53  ,𝜌35=−0.38 , 𝜌36=−0.49 ). \\nHowever, variable 1 has no correlation with the other variables. When the correlation between two \\nvariables is less than 0.2 ( |𝜌|<0.2) we assume they are uncorrelated (Babak , O. and Deutsch, C.V., 2008 ). \\nLet’s reorder variables based on their correlations to each other  and have a new correlation matrix for \\nreordered variables.  Variable  2, 5 and 6 which have strong positive correlation to each other place in first, \\nsecond and third orders respectively.

In case of multi variables  mode or dealing with many secondary variables which is hard to \\npredict spatial distribution and dependency between variables, correlation matrix is  a key element  to \\ndescribe this dependency . The principal directions of data set variance are defined by pri ncipal \\ncomponents. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure to calculate eigenvalues  and \\neigenvectors of correlation matrix  which are principal component of data set , by dimension reduction.   \\n Introduction  \\nDependency refers to any statistical relationship between two random variables or two sets of data. Correlation refers to any of a broad class of statistical relationship involving dependence. Correlation between two set of data set 𝑋,𝑌 defined as:  \\n𝜌𝑋𝑌=𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟 (𝑋,𝑌)= 𝐶𝑜𝑣 (𝑋,𝑌)\\n𝜎𝑋𝜎𝑌=𝐸[(𝑋−𝜇𝑋)(𝑌−𝜇𝑌]\\n𝜎𝑋𝜎𝑌 (1) \\n𝐶𝑜𝑣 (𝑋,𝑌)=1\\n𝑁� (𝑋𝑖𝑛\\n𝑖=1−𝜇𝑋)(𝑌𝑖−𝜇𝑌) (2) \\n𝜎𝑋=�∑ (𝑋𝑖−𝜇𝑋)𝑛\\n𝑖=1\\n𝑛          𝜎𝑌=�∑ (𝑌𝑖−𝜇𝑌)𝑛\\n𝑖=1\\n𝑛 (3) \\nWhere 𝜌,𝐸 𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝐶𝑜𝑣 , are correlation, expected value and covariance operator respectively, 𝜇   is the \\nmean, 𝜎 is standard deviation  and 𝑛 is number of variables.  The correlation is +1 in the case of a perfect \\npositive linear relationship, −1 in th e case of a perfect negative linear relationship,  and some value \\nbetween −1 and 1 in all other cases, indicating the degree of linear dependence  between the variables. As \\nit approaches zero there is less of a relationship (closer to uncorrelated). The clos er the coefficient is to \\neither −1 or 1, the stronger the correlation between the variables. The correlation cannot exceed 1 in absolute value. When correlations among several variables are computed, they are typically \\nsummarized in the form of a correlati on matrix. Correlation matrices are built to describe the dependency \\nbetween different data sets and are symmetric as 𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟 (𝑋,𝑌)=𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟 (𝑌,𝑋). Correlation matrices must be \\npositive semi definite. It means for all Non -zero column vector  𝑍, 𝑍\\n𝑇𝜌𝑍>0 (𝑍𝑇 is the transpose of 𝑍 and  \\n𝜌 is correlation matrix).  \\nThe subject of multivariate analysis deals with the statistical analysis of the data collected on \\nmore than one variable. These variables may be correlated with each other, and their statistical \\ndependence is often taken into account when analyzing such data. Correlation matrix is a key element to \\nexplain and apply this dependency in multi variable mode.  In reservoir estimation the primary well data, \\nwhich is expensive to obtain by drilling is p redicted using the easy and cheap obtaining secondary seismic \\ndata.  Correlation matrix can be useful for spatial prediction and dimension reduction when we are dealing with many secondary variables  (Kumar , A. and Deutsch, C.V. , 2009, CCG annual report ). \\n \\nEigenvalues and eigenvectors : \\nPrincipal component of a data set are found by calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the data \\ncovariance matrix. In fact, eigenvalues are the variance of principal components .  Suppose that A is a \\nsquare matrix of size n, 𝑋≠0 is a vector in 𝐶\\n𝑛, and λ  is a scalar in C. Then 𝑋 is an eigenvector of A with \\neigenvalue λ, if 𝐴𝑋=λX.  The eigenvalues of a matrix  A are precisely the solutions λ to the characteristic \\nequation ( I is identity matrix).  \\ndet(𝐴−λI)=0 \\ndet(𝐴−λI)=det��𝑎11 0\\n0  𝑎22⋯   0\\n0   0\\n⋮   ⋮\\n0  0⋱  0\\n  0   𝑎𝑛𝑛�−λ�10\\n01… 0\\n… 0\\n⋮⋮\\n00⋱0\\n01��  \\n \\n \\n \\n(4) Paper 408, CCG Annual Report 14 , 2012 (© 2012)  \\n408- 2                        =𝑑𝑒𝑡�𝑎11−λ 0\\n0𝑎22−λ⋯           0\\n…           0\\n⋮            ⋮\\n0             0  ⋱           0\\n0   𝑎𝑛𝑛−λ� \\n                      =(𝑎11−λ)(𝑎22−λ)…(𝑎𝑛𝑛−λ)=0 \\n \\nThe solutions to this equation are the eigenvalues λ𝑖=𝑎𝑖𝑖 (i=1,2,…n).   When we deal with large size of \\nmatrices, get the eigenvalues and eigenvectors from characteristic equation is not an easy job. There are \\ntwo classes of numerical methods to calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors  (Panhuis , P.H.M. , 2005) : (1) \\nPartial methods  - computation of extrema eigenvalues such as power method, and (2) Global methods  - \\napproximation of whole spectrum such as:  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) , Multi -Dimensional Scaling \\n(MDS), and Factorization .  This report provides an introduction to global methods and specifically focuses \\non PCA method. MDS and factorization will be covered in future works.  \\n \\nPrincipal Co mponent Analysis (PCA) : \\nPrincipal Component Analysis, or simply PCA, is a statistical procedure concerned with elucidating the \\ncovariance structure of a set of variables. In particular it allows us to identify the principal directions in \\nwhich the data varies. Principal Component  Analysis (PCA) is a method of identifying the pattern of data \\nset by a much smaller number of “new” variables, named as principal components  (Gillies,D., ,2005) .  For \\ne x a m p l e ,  i n  ﬁ g u r e  1 ,  s u p p o s e  t h a t  t h e  s m a l l  c i r c l e s  r e p r e s e n t  a  t w o  v a r i a b l e  d a t a  s e t  w h i ch we have \\nmeasured in the X -Y coordinate system.  \\nRed Circles:            𝑥1,𝑥2,… 𝑥𝑛                                        𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛=𝜇𝑥 \\nBlue Circle            𝑦1,𝑦2,…,𝑦𝑛                                       𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛=𝜇𝑦 \\nThe principal directi on in which the data varies is shown by the U axis and the second most important \\ndirection is the V axis orthogonal to it. If we place the [U,V] axis system at the mean of the data (𝜇𝑥, 𝜇𝑦) it \\ngives us a compact representation. If we transform each [X,Y ] coordinate into its corresponding [U,V] \\nvalue, the data is de -correlated, meaning that the co -variance between the U and V variables is zero.  For \\na given set of data, principal component analysis ﬁnds the axis system deﬁned by the principal directions o\\nf  v a r i a n c e  ( i e  t h e  [ U , V ]  a x i s  s y s t e m  i n  ﬁ g u r e  1 )  .

In this case we show the nominal extent of the \\nnormal distribution by a hyper -ellipse (the two dimensional ellipse in Figure1). The hyper ellipse encloses \\ndata points that are thought of as belonging to a class. It is drawn at a distance beyond which the \\nprobability of a point belonging to the class is low, and can be thought of as a class boundary.  \\nIf the variation in the data is caused by some other relationship, then PCA gives us a way of \\nreducing the dimensionali ty of a data set. Consider two variables that are nearly related linearly as shown \\nin ﬁgure2. As in ﬁgure1 the principal direction in which the data varies is shown by the U axis and the \\nsecondary direction by the V axis. However in this case all the V coo rdinates are very close to zero. We \\nmay assume, for example, that they are only non -zero because of experimental noise  or measurement \\n  Paper 408, CCG Annual Report 14 , 2012 (© 2012)  \\n408- 3 error. Thus in the U -V axis system we can represent the data set by one variable U and discard V. Thus we \\nhave reduced the  dimensionality of the problem by 1.  \\nIn computational terms the principal components are found by calculating the eigenvectors and \\neigenvalues of the data covariance matrix. This process is equivalent to finding the axis system in which \\nthe co -variance mat rix is diagonal. The eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue is the direction of greatest \\nvariation, the one with the second largest eigenvalue is the (orthogonal) direction with the next highest \\nvariation and so on. In the other word, eigenvalues are the variance of principal components. The first \\neigenvalue is the variance of the first principal component; the second eigenvalue is the variance of the \\nsecond principal component and so on (Gillies,D., 2005) . \\nThe eigenvalues of A, 𝑛 ×𝑛 matrix, are defined as the roots of:  \\ndet(𝐴−λ)=|𝐴−λI|=0 (5) \\nLet λ be an eigenvalue of A. Then there exists a vector 𝑥 such that:  \\n𝐴𝑥=λ𝑥 (6) \\nThe vector 𝑥  is called an eigenvector of A, associated with the eigenvalue λ . Notice that there is no \\nunique solution for 𝑥  in the above equation. It is a direction vector only and can be scaled to any \\nmagnitude. To find a numerical solution for 𝑥 we need to set one of its elements to an arbitrary value, say \\n1, which gives us a set of simultaneous equations to solve for the other elements. If there is no solution \\nwe repeat the process with another element. Ordinarily we normalize the final values so that 𝑥  has length \\none, that is 𝑥 .𝑥𝑇=1. \\nSuppose we have a 3×3 matrix A with eigenvectors 𝑥1,𝑥2,𝑥3 and eigenvalues λ1,λ2,λ3 so: \\n𝐴𝑥1=λ1𝑥1                  𝐴𝑥2=𝜆2𝑥2                𝐴𝑥3=𝜆3𝑥3                 (7) \\nPutting the eigenvectors as the columns of a matrix gives:  \\n𝐴[𝑥1𝑥2𝑥3]=�λ1 0 0\\n0λ2 0\\n0 0λ3�[𝑥1𝑥2𝑥3]   (8) \\nWriting:  \\n𝜑=[𝑥1𝑥2𝑥3]                     ʌ=�λ1 0 0\\n0λ2 0\\n0 0λ3�  (9) \\nGives us the matrix equation:  \\n𝐴𝜑=ʌ𝜑  (10) \\nWe normalized the eigenvectors to unit magnitude, and they are orthogonal, so:  \\n𝜑𝜑𝑇=𝜑𝑇𝜑=𝐼  (5) \\nThis means that:  \\n𝜑𝑇𝐴𝜑=ʌ  (6) \\nAnd:  \\n𝐴=𝜑ʌ𝜑𝑇  (7) \\nN o w  l e t  u s  c o n s i d e r  h o w  t h i s  a p p l i e s  t o  t h e  c o v a r i a n c e  m a t r i x  i n  t h e  P C A  p r o c e s s .  L e t  Σ  b e  a  𝑛×𝑛 \\ncovariance matrix. There is an orthogonal  𝑛 ×𝑛 matrix 𝜑 whose columns are eigenvectors of Σ and a \\ndiagonal matrix ʌ  whose diagonal elements are the eigenvalues of Σ, such that:  \\n𝜑Σ𝜑𝑇=ʌ  (8) \\nWe can look on the matrix of eigenvectors 𝜑 as a linear transformation which, in the example of figure1 \\ntransforms data points in the [X, Y] axis system into the [U,V] axis system. In the general case the linear transformation given by 𝜑  transforms the data points into a data set where the variabl es are \\nuncorrelated. The correlation matrix of the data in the new coordinate system is ʌ which has zeros in all \\nthe off diagonal elements.  \\nPrincipal component analysis is appropriate when you have obtained measures on a number of \\nobserved variables and wi sh to develop a smaller number of artificial variables (called principal \\ncomponents) that will account for most of the variance in the observed variables.  Some limitations of PCA  \\n(Izenman, A. J.,2008) : (1) The directions with largest variance are assumed to be of most interest.  (2) We \\nonly consider orthogonal transformations (rotations) of the original variables. (Kernel PCA is an extension \\nof PCA that allows non -linear mappings).  (3) PCA is based only on the mean vector and the covariance \\nmatrix of the da ta. Some distributions (e.g. multivariate normal) are completely characterized by this, but Paper 408, CCG Annual Report 14 , 2012 (© 2012)  \\n408- 4 others are not.  (4) Dimension reduction can only be achieved if the original variables were correlated. If \\nthe original variables were uncorrelated, PCA does nothin g, except for ordering them according to their \\nvariance.  (5) PCA is not scale invariant.  \\n \\nImplementation  \\nIn this study, a program written in fortran90 code used to calculate correlation matrix, eigenvalues and \\neigenvectors for a data set with six variables. This code reads data set in ASCII format,  deletes null values \\n(use full valued subset to delete -999)  and it calculate s Mean, Standard deviation, Covariance and \\nCorrelation matrix for data set. Then calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the correlation matrix. \\nStandard GSLIB convention (corrmat_plot)  is used  to plot correlation matrix.  \\nCalculated corre lation matrix for six different variables displayed in Figure 3 . This is an \\nappropriate opportunity to review just how a correlation matrix is interpreted. The  rows and columns of \\nFigure  3 correspond to the six variables included in the analysis: Row 1 (and column 1) represents variable \\n1, row 2 (and column 2) represents variable 2, and so forth. When a given row and column intersect, you \\nwill find the correlation between the two correspond ing variables. For example, where the row for \\nvariable 2 intersects with the column for variable 1, you find a correlation of 0.14 ; this means that the \\ncorrelation between variables 1 and 2 is 0.14 . \\nBased on Figure 3, variables 2, 5 and 6 show relatively s trong positive correlation with one another \\n(𝜌25=0.76  ,𝜌26=0.66 ,𝜌56=0.56 ) . \\nVariable 4 shows relatively strong negative correlation with variable 2, 5 and 6  (𝜌\\n42=−0.73  ,𝜌45=−0.59 ,𝜌46=−0.46 ). \\nVariable 3 also shows negative correlation with variab le 2, 5 and 6 \\n (𝜌32=−0.53  ,𝜌35=−0.38 , 𝜌36=−0.49 ). \\nHowever, variable 1 has no correlation with the other variables. When the correlation between two \\nvariables is less than 0.2 ( |𝜌|<0.2) we assume they are uncorrelated (Babak , O. and Deutsch, C.V., 2008 ). \\nLet’s reorder variables based on their correlations to each other  and have a new correlation matrix for \\nreordered variables.  Variable  2, 5 and 6 which have strong positive correlation to each other place in first, \\nsecond and third orders respectively. Variable 4 and 3 which have negative correlation with variables 2, 5 and 6 place in fourth and fifth order respectively. Variable 1 has no correlation with the other vari ables \\nplaces at the last order.  \\n1 Ni(V1)  Fe(V2)  \\n2 Fe(V2)  Co(V5)  \\n3 SiO2(V3)  Al2O3(V6)  \\n4 MgO(V4)  MgO(V4)  \\n5 Co(V5)  SiO2(V3)  \\n6 Al2O3(V6)  Ni(V1)  \\nTable1 : Reordering variables based on their correlation  \\n \\n \\nFigure 3 : Correlation matrix for six different variables       \\n Figure 4: Correlation matrix based on reorder ed variables  \\nPaper 408, CCG Annual Report 14 , 2012 (© 2012)  \\n408- 5 The new correlation matrix ( Figure 4) shows that the six variables seem to hang together in three distinct \\ngroups. First group, variable2,5 and 6 which they have strong positive correlation to each other. Second \\ngroup, variable3 and 4 which they have negative correlations with group1. The last group is variable1 has \\nno correlation with the rest of variables  (Figure 5). This is the redundancy of six variables to three.  In \\nessence, this is what accomplished by correlation matrix. In multivariate analysis mode or when dealing \\nwith many secondary variables, correlation matrix allows you to reduce a set of observed variables into a \\nsmaller set of artificial variables which called dimension reduction.  \\n \\nFigure 5: Three distinct groups of variables  \\n \\nEigenvalues and eigenvectors are calculated for this correlation matrix and displayed on Table 2.

In case of multi variables  mode or dealing with many secondary variables which is hard to \\npredict spatial distribution and dependency between variables, correlation matrix is  a key element  to \\ndescribe this dependency . The principal directions of data set variance are defined by pri ncipal \\ncomponents. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure to calculate eigenvalues  and \\neigenvectors of correlation matrix  which are principal component of data set , by dimension reduction.   \\n Introduction  \\nDependency refers to any statistical relationship between two random variables or two sets of data. Correlation refers to any of a broad class of statistical relationship involving dependence. Correlation between two set of data set 𝑋,𝑌 defined as:  \\n𝜌𝑋𝑌=𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟 (𝑋,𝑌)= 𝐶𝑜𝑣 (𝑋,𝑌)\\n𝜎𝑋𝜎𝑌=𝐸[(𝑋−𝜇𝑋)(𝑌−𝜇𝑌]\\n𝜎𝑋𝜎𝑌 (1) \\n𝐶𝑜𝑣 (𝑋,𝑌)=1\\n𝑁� (𝑋𝑖𝑛\\n𝑖=1−𝜇𝑋)(𝑌𝑖−𝜇𝑌) (2) \\n𝜎𝑋=�∑ (𝑋𝑖−𝜇𝑋)𝑛\\n𝑖=1\\n𝑛          𝜎𝑌=�∑ (𝑌𝑖−𝜇𝑌)𝑛\\n𝑖=1\\n𝑛 (3) \\nWhere 𝜌,𝐸 𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝐶𝑜𝑣 , are correlation, expected value and covariance operator respectively, 𝜇   is the \\nmean, 𝜎 is standard deviation  and 𝑛 is number of variables.  The correlation is +1 in the case of a perfect \\npositive linear relationship, −1 in th e case of a perfect negative linear relationship,  and some value \\nbetween −1 and 1 in all other cases, indicating the degree of linear dependence  between the variables. As \\nit approaches zero there is less of a relationship (closer to uncorrelated). The clos er the coefficient is to \\neither −1 or 1, the stronger the correlation between the variables. The correlation cannot exceed 1 in absolute value. When correlations among several variables are computed, they are typically \\nsummarized in the form of a correlati on matrix. Correlation matrices are built to describe the dependency \\nbetween different data sets and are symmetric as 𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟 (𝑋,𝑌)=𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟 (𝑌,𝑋). Correlation matrices must be \\npositive semi definite. It means for all Non -zero column vector  𝑍, 𝑍\\n𝑇𝜌𝑍>0 (𝑍𝑇 is the transpose of 𝑍 and  \\n𝜌 is correlation matrix).  \\nThe subject of multivariate analysis deals with the statistical analysis of the data collected on \\nmore than one variable. These variables may be correlated with each other, and their statistical \\ndependence is often taken into account when analyzing such data. Correlation matrix is a key element to \\nexplain and apply this dependency in multi variable mode.  In reservoir estimation the primary well data, \\nwhich is expensive to obtain by drilling is p redicted using the easy and cheap obtaining secondary seismic \\ndata.  Correlation matrix can be useful for spatial prediction and dimension reduction when we are dealing with many secondary variables  (Kumar , A. and Deutsch, C.V. , 2009, CCG annual report ). \\n \\nEigenvalues and eigenvectors : \\nPrincipal component of a data set are found by calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the data \\ncovariance matrix.

When we deal with large size of \\nmatrices, get the eigenvalues and eigenvectors from characteristic equation is not an easy job. There are \\ntwo classes of numerical methods to calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors  (Panhuis , P.H.M. , 2005) : (1) \\nPartial methods  - computation of extrema eigenvalues such as power method, and (2) Global methods  - \\napproximation of whole spectrum such as:  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) , Multi -Dimensional Scaling \\n(MDS), and Factorization .  This report provides an introduction to global methods and specifically focuses \\non PCA method. MDS and factorization will be covered in future works.  \\n \\nPrincipal Co mponent Analysis (PCA) : \\nPrincipal Component Analysis, or simply PCA, is a statistical procedure concerned with elucidating the \\ncovariance structure of a set of variables. In particular it allows us to identify the principal directions in \\nwhich the data varies. Principal Component  Analysis (PCA) is a method of identifying the pattern of data \\nset by a much smaller number of “new” variables, named as principal components  (Gillies,D., ,2005) .

In this case we show the nominal extent of the \\nnormal distribution by a hyper -ellipse (the two dimensional ellipse in Figure1). The hyper ellipse encloses \\ndata points that are thought of as belonging to a class. It is drawn at a distance beyond which the \\nprobability of a point belonging to the class is low, and can be thought of as a class boundary.  \\nIf the variation in the data is caused by some other relationship, then PCA gives us a way of \\nreducing the dimensionali ty of a data set. Consider two variables that are nearly related linearly as shown \\nin ﬁgure2. As in ﬁgure1 the principal direction in which the data varies is shown by the U axis and the \\nsecondary direction by the V axis. However in this case all the V coo rdinates are very close to zero. We \\nmay assume, for example, that they are only non -zero because of experimental noise  or measurement \\n  Paper 408, CCG Annual Report 14 , 2012 (© 2012)  \\n408- 3 error. Thus in the U -V axis system we can represent the data set by one variable U and discard V. Thus we \\nhave reduced the  dimensionality of the problem by 1.  \\nIn computational terms the principal components are found by calculating the eigenvectors and \\neigenvalues of the data covariance matrix. This process is equivalent to finding the axis system in which \\nthe co -variance mat rix is diagonal. The eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue is the direction of greatest \\nvariation, the one with the second largest eigenvalue is the (orthogonal) direction with the next highest \\nvariation and so on. In the other word, eigenvalues are the variance of principal components. The first \\neigenvalue is the variance of the first principal component; the second eigenvalue is the variance of the \\nsecond principal component and so on (Gillies,D., 2005) . \\nThe eigenvalues of A, 𝑛 ×𝑛 matrix, are defined as the roots of:  \\ndet(𝐴−λ)=|𝐴−λI|=0 (5) \\nLet λ be an eigenvalue of A. Then there exists a vector 𝑥 such that:  \\n𝐴𝑥=λ𝑥 (6) \\nThe vector 𝑥  is called an eigenvector of A, associated with the eigenvalue λ . Notice that there is no \\nunique solution for 𝑥  in the above equation. It is a direction vector only and can be scaled to any \\nmagnitude. To find a numerical solution for 𝑥 we need to set one of its elements to an arbitrary value, say \\n1, which gives us a set of simultaneous equations to solve for the other elements. If there is no solution \\nwe repeat the process with another element. Ordinarily we normalize the final values so that 𝑥  has length \\none, that is 𝑥 .𝑥𝑇=1. \\nSuppose we have a 3×3 matrix A with eigenvectors 𝑥1,𝑥2,𝑥3 and eigenvalues λ1,λ2,λ3 so: \\n𝐴𝑥1=λ1𝑥1                  𝐴𝑥2=𝜆2𝑥2                𝐴�'),\n",

Some limitations of PCA  \\n(Izenman, A. J.,2008) : (1) The directions with largest variance are assumed to be of most interest.  (2) We \\nonly consider orthogonal transformations (rotations) of the original variables. (Kernel PCA is an extension \\nof PCA that allows non -linear mappings).  (3) PCA is based only on the mean vector and the covariance \\nmatrix of the da ta. Some distributions (e.g. multivariate normal) are completely characterized by this, but Paper 408, CCG Annual Report 14 , 2012 (© 2012)  \\n408- 4 others are not.  (4) Dimension reduction can only be achieved if the original variables were correlated. If \\nthe original variables were uncorrelated, PCA does nothin g, except for ordering them according to their \\nvariance.

The  rows and columns of \\nFigure  3 correspond to the six variables included in the analysis: Row 1 (and column 1) represents variable \\n1, row 2 (and column 2) represents variable 2, and so forth. When a given row and column intersect, you \\nwill find the correlation between the two correspond ing variables. For example, where the row for \\nvariable 2 intersects with the column for variable 1, you find a correlation of 0.14 ; this means that the \\ncorrelation between variables 1 and 2 is 0.14 . \\nBased on Figure 3, variables 2, 5 and 6 show relatively s trong positive correlation with one another \\n(𝜌25=0.76  ,𝜌26=0.66 ,𝜌56=0.56 ) . \\nVariable 4 shows relatively strong negative correlation with variable 2, 5 and 6  (𝜌\\n42=−0.73  ,𝜌45=−0.59 ,𝜌46=−0.46 ). \\nVariable 3 also shows negative correlation with variab le 2, 5 and 6 \\n (𝜌32=−0.53  ,𝜌35=−0.38 , 𝜌36=−0.49 ). \\nHowever, variable 1 has no correlation with the other variables.

      "Answer:  The concept of Optimal Correlation of Indefinite Correlation Matrices, as discussed in the CCG annual report, refers to the process of determining the best possible correlation between different data sets represented by correlation matrices. In the context of multivariate statistical analysis, correlation matrices are used to describe the dependency between various variables. The optimal correlation aims to capture the most accurate and meaningful relationships between these variables, especially when dealing with complex data sets where spatial distribution and dependencies are hard to predict.\n",
      "\n",
      "By calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors of correlation matrices, techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are employed to reduce the dimensions of the data and identify the principal components that explain the variance within the data set. This process helps in understanding the underlying structure of the data and finding the most significant correlations between variables. The goal of achieving optimal correlation is to enhance the interpretation and application of the data in various analytical processes, such as reservoir estimation or spatial prediction.\n",

      "Answer:  To find the optimal correlation of indefinite correlation matrices, you can apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) techniques as discussed in the text. PCA helps in calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the correlation matrices, which are the principal components of the data set. By dimension reduction, PCA allows you to identify the principal directions of data set variance.\n",

      "Answer:  Eigenvalues play a significant role in multivariate statistical techniques, particularly in methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In the context of multivariate analysis, eigenvalues represent the variance of the principal components of a dataset. By calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix, we can identify the principal directions in which the data varies. These eigenvalues help in dimension reduction, allowing us to represent the data with a smaller number of variables while retaining the most important information. Eigenvalues provide insights into the structure and relationships within the dataset, aiding in data interpretation, visualization, and pattern recognition.\n",

      "Answer:  To apply Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) to a dataset, you would typically follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure that your dataset is in a suitable format for MDS analysis. MDS is used to visualize the level of similarity or dissimilarity between data points, so your dataset should consist of pairwise dissimilarity or similarity measures between the data points.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Choosing a Distance Metric**: Decide on the appropriate distance metric to use for calculating the dissimilarities between data points. Common distance metrics include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, or correlation-based distances.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Performing MDS Analysis**: Use software or programming tools that support MDS analysis to calculate the spatial representation of the data points based on their dissimilarities. MDS aims to represent the data in a lower-dimensional space while preserving the original pairwise distances as much as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Interpreting the Results**: Once the MDS analysis is complete, you will obtain a visual representation of the data points in a lower-dimensional space. Insights gained from the results include:\n",
      "   - **Cluster Identification**: MDS can help identify clusters or groups of data points that are similar to each other.\n",
      "   - **Outlier Detection**: Outliers in the dataset may be visually apparent in the MDS plot.\n",
      "   - **Dimensionality Reduction**: MDS reduces the dimensionality of the data while preserving the relationships between data points, making it easier to interpret and visualize.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Validation and Interpretation**: Validate the MDS results by assessing how well the lower-dimensional representation captures the original dissimilarities in the data. Interpret the spatial arrangement of data points in the MDS plot to gain insights into the underlying structure of the dataset.\n",
      "\n",
